      <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
      <p>Coming into WRIT 5662, my digital literacy hadn’t progressed much further than basic smartphone usage and web surfing. So, going into the first major project, building a static site with HTML and CSS, was intimidating to say the least. After going through many tutorials and lots of trial and error, I felt much more confident about building a website from the ground up. I also enjoyed the process of reflecting on my digital literacy for the first version of my static site and revisiting memories of MySpace and Chip’s Challenge. After constructing the page, the next step was figuring out how to host the dang thing with GitHub. That process required more trials and errors (and curse words), but I eventually read enough documentation to successfully host my site. Woo!</p>
      <h1>I (The Audience) Have Needs, Too!</h1>
      <p>The next leg of the journey was about UX design and meetings the needs of the audience. Working with Daphne Walmer to imagine a redesign for the MN Austin Healey club was a rewarding experience and helped put what I was learning about user-focused design into context (particularly information from the Ginny Redish readings). Planning out the use cases for the users of the site and anticipating limitations like low-vision and the low-digital literacy of the users helped me to think about content in a new way and led me on a side quest to learn more about accessibility concepts that could help make my content more easily available to a wider audience. </p>
      <h1>Straight to the (Single) Source</h1>
      <p>The next major development in my digital literacy was discovering the world of DITA and structured authoring. It took awhile for the concept of single-sourcing and working with topics as a unit of information to stick in my brain, but after several articles and tutorials, it finally clicked. After working with HTML and CSS earlier in the course, the concept of using tags made sense, but there were so many tags to think about! Luckily, working with oXygen XML editor made things a bit easier by restricting what tags I could use depending on the topic type. Creating my own DITA map for “Knitting Basics” and all the related pages was an arduous process but it was ultimately very satisfying to see all of my work transform into a website and PDFs. </p>
      <h1>Web (Site) 2.0</h1>
      <p>It’s amazing to see how far my digital literacy has evolved over the course of only a semester. My first version of a static site was incredibly basic, and while I would still consider this version as relatively basic, I have made leaps and bounds in the ultimate complexity of my coding. My biggest successes on this project were figuring out how to include a navigation bar and making sure the links to the content actually worked and diving deeper into CSS work to make a more visually pleasing deliverable. Overall, I feel much more confident in my digital abilities (as well as having expanded resources for working on said abilities), and I am grateful for the instruction of Professor Card and my supportive community of classmates.</p>
